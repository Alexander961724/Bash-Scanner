# Bash-Scanner
Self bash scanner. 
üîç Port ScannerA simple Bash script that scans ports 1-30 on 127.0.0.1 (localhost) to identify open ports. It uses /dev/tcp for connectivity testing and includes a timeout mechanism to avoid infinite waits.
üöÄ How It Works1Ô∏è‚É£ The script displays a message and waits 3 seconds before starting the scan.2Ô∏è‚É£ It loops through ports 1 to 30, attempting to establish a connection.3Ô∏è‚É£ If a connection succeeds, the port is marked as open.4Ô∏è‚É£ If no open ports are found, the script notifies the user.

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes‚úÖ Works on Linux/macOS with Bash.
‚úÖ Scans localhost (127.0.0.1) only.
‚úÖ Modify the port range by changing seq 1 30.
‚úÖ Run as a normal user (no root required).
